anagram.bf Kalyna Zazelenchuk 1/1/93 This program will input a string of sixteen characters or less, and (p)ut those characters in order on line 3 (the line with the *'s). It will then randomly find numbers from 1 to 16, (g)et the characters at line 3 in random order, replace them with *'s, and print them out. Effectively produces anagrams of words you type in. It uses the code from 'rand2.bf' to generate random numbers.

numer.bf CC0 Chris Pressey 1/1/93 Produces single-digit numerological equivalents of words you type in. (Users should be warned that the significance of the output of this program is of extremely questionable practical value. But it is consistant.) (This algorithm is also known as the "digital root".)

pairing.bf Aaron Dale 3/20/97 A program to implement the "pairing function" (<x1,x2> = (2^(x1) * (2*(x2) + 1)) - 1), which maps any two natural numbers onto the set of natural numbers, without repetition.

pangram.bf CC0 Chris Pressey 8/25/12 Checks if the first line of input is a pangram -- a sentence which contains all the letters of the alphabet, such as "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" or "Pack my lunch box with five dozen liquor jugs."
